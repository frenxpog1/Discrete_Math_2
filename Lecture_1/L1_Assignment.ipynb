    "\\subsection*{Problem 1: Proof of Irrationality of Euler's Number}\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the definition of a rational number, denoted as $\\mathbb{Q}$. Prove that Euler's number $e = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k!} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\textbf{Proof:} Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $e$ is rational. Then, $e$ can be expressed as $e = \\frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers with no common factors other than 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the series expansion of $e$:\n",
    "$$e = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k!} = 1 + 1 + \\frac{1}{2!} + \\frac{1}{3!} + \\frac{1}{4!} + \\ldots$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $n$ be the smallest positive integer such that $\\frac{1}{n!} < \\frac{1}{b}$. Such an $n$ must exist since the factorial grows faster than any polynomial function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the partial sum $S = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\frac{1}{k!}$. Each term of $S$ is a positive rational number, and since rational numbers are closed under addition, $S$ is also a rational number.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, $S < e$ since $e$ is defined as the limit of the series, and $S = \\frac{a'}{b'}$ for some positive integers $a'$ and $b'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This contradicts the fact that $e$ is the smallest upper bound of the partial sums, as $S$ is also an upper bound but smaller than $e$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, our assumption that $e$ is rational is false, and thus $e$ is irrational.\n",

    "\\subsection*{Problem 2: Proof of Minkowski's Inequality}\n",

    "Prove Minkowski's Inequality for sums: $\\forall \\ p>1, (a_k, b_k)>0$:\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "\\textbf{Proof:} To prove Minkowski's Inequality, we use the triangle inequality and Holder's inequality. By the triangle inequality, $|a_k + b_k| \\leq |a_k| + |b_k|$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Elevating both sides to the $p$-th power and summing over $k$, we get $\\sum_{k=1}^n |a_k + b_k|^p \\leq (\\sum_{k=1}^n |a_k|^p) + (\\sum_{k=1}^n |b_k|^p)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the $p$-th root on both sides, we obtain Minkowski's inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, Minkowski's inequality holds for any real numbers $a_k$ and $b_k$, and for any $p > 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\subsection*{Problem 3: Proof of Triangle Inequality}\n",
    "\n",
    "Prove the triangle inequality $|x+y| \\leq |x| + |y|, \\forall (x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\textbf{Proof:} Let $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "|x + y| &= |(x + y)| \\quad \\text{(By definition of absolute value)} \\\\\n",
    "&= |x| + |y| \\quad \\text{(By definition of addition)} \\\\\n",
    "&\\leq |x| + |y| \\quad \\text{(Since $|x|, |y|$ are non-negative)}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the triangle inequality holds for all real numbers $x$ and $y$.\n",

    "\\subsection*{Problem 4: Proof of Sedrakayan's Lemma}\n",

    "\n",
    "\\textbf{Proof:} We will use Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality. Let $a_i = \\sqrt{v_i}u_i$ and $b_i = 1$. Then, applying Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, we have:\n",
